# VHDL_Circuits 2
Some circuits that i did in college

### Circuit 1
implementation of a sequential circuit that produces a clock sign with a frequency of 1 Hz (CLK_1HZ) based on the nominal clock of the de1-soc board that operates at a frequency of 50 MHz (CLK_50MHz) 

### Circuit 2
Implementation of a state machine synchronized with the 1hz clock. The state machine operates in the following sequence: 000, 001, 010, 100, with 000 the initial state.

### Circuit 3
Implementation of a state machine synchronized with the 1hz clock. The state machine operates in the following sequence: 00, 01, 10, 11.

### Circuit 4
Implementation of a state machine synchronized with the 1hz clock. Using "Gray Code" the state machine operates in the following sequence: 000, 010, 011, 001, 101, 111, 110, 100 with 000 the initial state.
